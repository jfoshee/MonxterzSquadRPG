## Need from Game State System

- CLI
  - Init
    - creates a new monxterz.proj.json
    - creates the unit test project
  - New script
    - mutator
    - initializer
  - Bootstrap the game owner entity
    - because it needs to be created by a different user (e.g. system)
- Game test harness 
  - initializer/creator
  - `Call` should be a property
- Mutation
  - Multiple targets
    - e.g. so can remove health from another entity when it is my turn
